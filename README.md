# Brain-Funk-Interpreter

[Brainfunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric programing language designed to use the minimum amount of instructions while still being Turing complete.

'>' Increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).

'<' Decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).

'+' Increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.

'-' Decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.

'.' Output the byte at the data pointer.

',' Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.

'[' If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.

']' If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.

This repo contains an interpreter and some example programs to begin, including ADDing, SUBtracting, MULTiplying.
